# Mysurance
## Description
Myinsurance is a small React-Native application that helps you keep track of your insurances.

## How to use it
```
git clone https://github.com/mottet-dev/mysurance.git
cd mysurance
npm install
npm start
```

You can then run it on an Android / IOS Emulator or on your phone if you have the [Expo](https://expo.io/) Application installed.

## Things that can be improved
- Improve testing on Components.
- Add Input validations to the 'AddInsuranceForm' Component.
- Add Redux-Persist to the project so data will not be ereased when the user leaves the application.
